![neon regex demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deliton/neon-regex/master/neon-regex.png)


This is a simple javascript regex testing tool that contains a fancy dark mode with neon-styled characters. It was made by me using the well established React framework.

## Description

A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory. 

## Instructions and how to use it

- The input field on the left represents the regular expression string that will be used to match strings in other input.
- The big input on the right correspond to the target text, that will use the regular expression to match strings inside itself.
- Just write something in the target text input and try to find interesting regex patterns to match.


## Building it

In order to run it locally, you need nodeJS installed on your computer. After installing it, do the following:

```console
user@admin:~$ cd neon-regex
user@admin:~$ npm install
user@admin:~$ npm start

```

And then, just open http://localhost:3000
